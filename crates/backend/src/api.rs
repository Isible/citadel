/// # Introduction
///
/// The Backend trait. A Backend is the part
/// of a compiler responsible for generating
/// machine code or some other kind of low-level
/// representation for your code like assembly,
/// web-assembly...
///
/// Fortunately you don't need to write these backends
/// yourself, but can use backends that are made by
/// the community. Popular backends are: \[WIP\]
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// For creating a new backend, simply implement
/// this type for your backend's struct.
///
/// The backend requires you to define 2 types.
/// These are: [Backend::Target], [Backend::Output]
///
/// ## [Backend::Target]
///
/// This type specifies the Target that the backend should compile to.
/// There are 3 different cases for filling this type.
/// 1. You are building a backend that only needs to work on one target.<p>
///    => you can set [Backend::Target] to this specific target.
/// 2. You are building a relativley small backend that should compile to
///    multiple targets<p>
///    => you should use a generic for the backend and then set [Backend::Target]
///    to that generic.
/// 3. You are building a larger backend that produces something like machine code or assembly.<p>
///    => Create a specific backend for your target or
///    target architecture that spits out machine code,
///    assembly or something like that.
///
/// ## [Backend::Output]
///
/// This is the type that gets returned after generating the code.
/// It should ideally be a [Vec], but can in fact be any type
/// that implements [IntoIterator].
///
/// **Example**: Vec<AsmElement> if your backend compiles to assembly
///
/// Note: The element in the iterator needs to implement Display
/// so the code can be outputted to a file easily.
///
/// TODO: Trait methods

    /// Main function of the backend. This will take in a stream
    /// of IRStmts and generate code based on them. The target for
    /// code generation is [`Backend::Target`]
    fn generate(&self, ir_stream: LIRStream<'b>) -> Self::Output;

    /// This returns the target of the backend instance.
    ///

    /// to be able to handle multiple targets and generate
    /// code based on the selected target
    fn target(&self) -> Self::Target {
        Self::Target::default()
    }

    /// This is for outputting a file.
    /// If your backend compiles to something
    /// like assembly that is represented in
    /// plain text, you can return None.
    ///
    /// If youre backend compiles to something
    /// like machine code however, you will need
    /// to handle file creation yourself using
    /// the citadel apis. In that case you should
    /// return Some(...) and the result of whether
    /// file creation was successful
    fn to_file<P>(&self, output: &Self::Output, path: P) -> io::Result<()>
    where
        P: AsRef<Path>;

    /// This is for formatting outputted code.
    /// By default your backend does not support
    /// code formatting and thus it returns None.
    ///
    /// If you do want your code to be formatable,
    /// you need to return Some(...) and the outputted
    /// and formatted string
