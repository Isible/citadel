# Frontend [lib]

This is the frontend crate. It is the part of the compiler responsible for generating an intermediary representation.
Like most of the other -end crates in Citadel this is a pure api for providing the high-level intermediary representation
and utilities for generating it.

## Using the frontend

For now you will have to look at how we use the frontend to generate IR in test-lang.
